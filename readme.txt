I have implemented functionalities below:
upload, download, list, delete, add, remove
Things should know before using:
1. Many files are under the directory, they are all the files which will be used in t14.dat auto test
1. Valid IP is from 129.210.16.70 to 129.210.16.100
2. If you want to input with host name, please just input the first part,e.g.linux60811
3. If you want to terminate client, please input end as command
Thanks a lot!
4. t10.dat is a valid input for the server
   t13.dat is used for test md5Sum
   t14.dat is a list of command to test 
   t15.dat is a list of command to test upload 
   t18.dat and t19.dat is invalid input
   When you start client, you will be asked to input a choice. If you input 1, you will use commands in t14.dat to do the test. If you input 2, you will do the test mannually.
Sincerely,
Zihao
